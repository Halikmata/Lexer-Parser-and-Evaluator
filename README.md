This program takes two input x and y and runs it through lexical analysis through a lexer function where it it broken up into tokens.
Then it runs through parser function where an Abstract Syntax Tree or AST is constructed. 
Then it is evaluated using the evaluate function that has its personal parser and lexer too which uses a different algorithm.
